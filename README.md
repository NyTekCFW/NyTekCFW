# Hello, I'm Laurent, also known as NyTekCFW.

## Introduction:

I'm a French developer and currently a Computer Science student at 42 School.

My journey in development began in 2012 on Playstation 3. Before becoming a 42 School student, I taught myself a lot of things. My interest sparked after discovering mods on games. While it was both enjoyable and intriguing, I found that many mods were incomplete. This motivated me to delve deeper into understanding their creation process so that I could develop my own mods.

I take pride in enhancing my creations and introducing new features with each update and add more fun contents.

In 2018, I co-founded the SVSC Modding Team with some developer friends. This team collaborates on various projects related to developpement.

I'm considering transitioning into game development because I enjoy how game are made and pushed thing at his limitðŸ˜‚
